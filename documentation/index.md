# Design Documentation

Learning to use the Hedera platform is a reasonably straightforward process using the officially supported JavaScript/TypeScript SDK, Java SDK and community supported SDKs for other languages.  Code examples and documentation are provided with those SDKs and developers getting started with Hedera can easily refer to them.

Beyond the SDKs, the cli tool accelerates the developer's learning process and simplifies the developer's application build-and-deploy lifecycle.

Specifically, the cli is designed with the following goals:

1. Provide an easy way for a developer to manage multiple Hedera accounts, toggle between mainnet/testnet networks and experiment with Hedera platform services with minimal effort

2. Help the developer to learn how to use Hedera effectively through experimentation with the various commands in the command line (REPL/Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop)

3. Leverage on the cli's plugin system to manage account security and test out third party features in the cli sandbox (e.g. integration with 1Password, Dashlane, Lastpass or HashingSystem's Name Service etc)

4. Securely test Hedera services without relying on third party tunneling software and tail API request logs in real time (e.g. a listener on Hedera Consensus Service)
